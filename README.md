# GAN from Scratch

## Overview

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the **Fashion MNIST** dataset, aiming to generate realistic clothing item images. The GAN consists of two neural networks:

- **Generator**: Creates new images from random noise.
- **Discriminator**: Evaluates images and distinguishes between real and generated images.

## Features

- Implements a **deep convolutional GAN** with upsampling in the generator.
- Uses **LeakyReLU activation** and **dropout regularization** in both networks.
- Includes **custom training logic** using TensorFlow's GradientTape.
- **Preprocesses the dataset** with normalization and efficient batching.
- Generates **Fashion MNIST-style images** from random noise.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the **Fashion MNIST** dataset, which consists of grayscale images of clothing items such as shirts, shoes, and bags.

- **Loaded via TensorFlow Datasets (`tfds`)**
- **Preprocessed**: Images are scaled to [0,1] range.
- **Batching and caching**: Uses efficient data pipeline operations.

## Architecture

### Generator
- Input: Random noise (128-dimensional)
- Fully connected layer reshaped to (7,7,128)
- Upsampling and **convolutional blocks** (Conv2D + LeakyReLU)
- Final Conv2D layer with **sigmoid activation** to produce 28x28 images

### Discriminator
- Input: 28x28 grayscale image
- **Convolutional layers** with increasing filters
- **LeakyReLU activations** and **dropout layers** for stability
- Flattened and passed to a dense layer with a **sigmoid output** (probability of being real/fake)

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3 and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow-datasets
```

## Usage

### Training

Run the following script to train the GAN:

```python
python train.py
```

The script:
1. Loads and preprocesses the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. Builds and compiles the generator and discriminator.
3. Trains the model using **custom training logic** with noise perturbation in labels.
4. Saves the model weights periodically.

### Generating Images

To generate new images from the trained model:

```python
python generate.py
```

This will display and save images generated by the GAN.

## Results

After training, the generator creates realistic-looking clothing items. The discriminator effectively distinguishes between real and fake images.

## Future Improvements

- Add **progressive growing** to improve training stability.
- Implement **conditional GANs (cGANs)** to generate specific clothing items.
- Experiment with **different loss functions** for better quality images.
